**Patient: **Yeah, it's uh, I'm just I feel like I can't, can't quite like breathe fully.
**Medical Student: **OK, uhm you can't quite breathe fully, so like when you take a deep breath in, you can't expand your lungs fully. Is that what you mean?
**Patient: **Yeah, yeah, I just overall I just feel like yeah, I'm I'm short of breath. I guess that's the best way to put it.

**Medical Student: **Alright and are you up to date with all your immunizations?
**Patient: **Uh, yeah.
**Medical Student: **Including like the pneumovax vaccine and the shingrix?
**Patient: **I had the shingrix the pneumo I think the doctor said we were going to look at that the next time I came in.
**Medical Student: **OK, sure.
**Patient: **So I I'm not sure I I know that I always say yes to these things, but I'm not sure because of Covid and stuff if I've been getting everything exactly on time.
**Medical Student: **Mhmm. OK, and how about uh, how about allergies? Do you have any allergies?
**Patient: **Oh, like uh, just seasonal. Not to any medications or anything.
**Medical Student: **OK. Uhm, have you been in touch with anyone sick recently around you?
**Patient: **No, like the only person I see is my husband. I guess him, and so he has a PSW that comes in to take care of him. He has a couple more problems than I do. So basically, we see I see him and her and we see we see our kids, but just like outside.
**Medical Student: **OK. OK and alright and then, uhm, have you traveled anywhere recently?
**Patient: **No, no
**Medical Student: **No, OK. Dietary wise, are you like eating healthy?
**Patient: **Yeah, yeah, I think so. I try to, you know, cook, you know, whole foods for us like lots of veggies and you know fish and good meat. Although in the past you know few days, I just 'cause I felt really rundown and fatigued, I haven't been eating as much as I normally do.
**Medical Student: **OK.
**Patient: **Otherwise, I think we pretty healthy I try to, you know, follow healthy recipes and find them online.
**Medical Student: **Yeah, for sure. Yeah, that's good. Do you, do you smoke?
**Patient: **No, no.
**Medical Student: **No, OK, and any other recreational drugs?
**Patient: **No, never.
**Medical Student: **OK. Do you drink alcohol?
**Patient: **I'll have the occasional glass of wine on a special occasion, but not frequently and not, not heavily.
**Medical Student: **OK. And where do you live and who do you live with right now?
**Patient: **Uh, just me and my husband. We live outside of town. We live in the country on a little farm.
**Medical Student: **OK. Any old carpets or dust or mold or asbestos in the, in the home?
**Patient: **No, no we renovated probably 15 years ago, and there's no no more carpet, and there were never any asbestos problems or anything.
**Medical Student: **OK. OK, well I think those are all the questions that I had. Did you have any questions for myself?
**Patient: **I don't think so. I just I hope you know we can get this figured out.
**Medical Student: **Yeah, for sure. So we'll start with doing a Covid swab because you have some symptoms that overlap with it, so you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with those results. But it does sound like what you're telling me with the wet cough and you know a little bit of shortness of breath, I think it's worthwhile to get a chest x-ray to see if you might possibly have a pneumonia, and if you do, if there is some consolidation we'll probably prescribe some antibiotics for that. Umm, how does that sound to you?
**Patient: **Sounds great to me. Yeah, I just you know, hope there's nothing serious going on.
**Medical Student: **Yeah, yeah, and it shouldn't be. It's probably 1 something that's been going around in the community and you haven't had any recent hospitalizations or surgery, so I wouldn't worry about like any of those atypical bugs just yet.
**Patient: **OK, OK, that's good to hear.
**Medical Student: **Yeah, for sure. Well, uhm, thank you.
**Control: **Add differential diagnosis
