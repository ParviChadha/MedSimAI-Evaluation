**Patient: **Uh, it's usually always, uh, produces like the sputum, and it's usually white or yellowish in colour.
**Medical Student: **OK, and how much sputum are you producing each day? Some, sometimes it's useful to think about like teaspoons or tablespoons.
**Patient: **I would say every time I cough like a teaspoon I probably have like. I don't know. Maybe 5 to 10 teaspoons a day.
**Medical Student: **Uh OK, and is there any particular time of day that the cough is worse?

**Medical Student: **OK, and have you been doing anything that's made it better?

**Patient: **Yeah, tried to quit. I've even quite a couple times but then just got back onto it. Yeah, not not really ready to quit.
**Medical Student: **OK. That's fair enough. If there's something that you wanted to talk about quitting smoking at another appointment, we can arrange follow up for that.
**Patient: **Alright
**Medical Student: **Do you drink alcohol?
**Patient: **Not much, just out say one or two beers on the weekend.
**Medical Student: **Alright, and you use any recreational drugs like cocaine, crystal meth, or IV drugs.
**Patient: **No, nothing like that.
**Medical Student: **Alright, and has anything similar like this happened in your family before?
**Patient: **Uh, I think my um sister has a COPD, like she smokes a lot too. But that's that's about, I don't know if that's genetic.
**Medical Student: **Oh OK, um I. So I mean anybody in the family have cancers?
**Patient: **Um no, not that I know of.
**Medical Student: **Alright um so, that that was all the questions that I wanted to ask on history. Was there any, uh, any other questions that you had?
**Patient: **No, not really. Just wanted to get to the bottom of this.
**Medical Student: **OK for sure so um we will run some investigations and likely get a chest X Ray because it's been a couple of months that these symptoms have been going on for. But I think it could be related to your smoking and most likely um Bronc, chronic bronchitis, but we can definitely will be looking into this, and then also with possibly some pulmonary function tests as well.
