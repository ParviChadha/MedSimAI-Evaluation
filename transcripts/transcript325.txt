**Medical Student: **OK, have you had shortness of breath after that, like when like as a child, how old were you?

**Medical Student: **OK, alright. Yeah, so those are kind of all the questions that I had for you. Sorry just one more question, any loss of sense of taste or smell?
**Patient: **Yeah, it's hard to smell and my nose is stuffy, but no loss of taste.
**Medical Student: **Yeah, OK. OK, so do you have any questions at all for me?
**Patient: **No, I just I I just wanna get some medications to help with this. I'm just sick and tired of my runny nose.
**Medical Student: **Yeah, it must be very frustrating. So you've tried Reactin before, right?
**Patient: **yeah
**Medical Student: **Yeah, so one method is to definitely like stay away from some of those allergens that are potentially causing your symptoms. But I I do really think so you might have something called like allergic rhinitis. And I think it might be beneficial to for you to see like an allergist
**Patient: **sure.
**Medical Student: **And so I can refer you to someone as well. Just have a sense of what kind of things allergic to you and like what medications you would require. In the meantime, definitely like any antihistamine medications would help with your symptoms. But since you're also having congestion and sneezing, just just in case, we will just do a COVID swab test for you today. And it takes around 24 to 48 hours to come back. And in the meantime, you should just isolate as much as you can in your own home. And then based on the result they would give you more instruction.
**Patient: **Sure
**Control: **Add differential diagnosis
