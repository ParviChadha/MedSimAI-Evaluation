**Patient: **No, nothing else I I I was just wondering what I could do to feel better or make this go away.
**Medical Student: **Yeah, certainly. So, I, so it's sounds like you have the common cold or a viral illness, which it could be caused by something like adenovirus or there are others as well. However, the symptoms do overlap with COVID. As you can be like nonspecific symptoms, such as having kind of just like a runny nose like you do here, and so we will do a COVID swab and we'll await those results, but in the meantime it's mostly supportive care, so it means just trying to stay hydrated, stay rested. And just monitor your symptoms because if things do get worse, it'll be important to, uh, go to the emergency room.
**Patient: **OK.
**Medical Student: **Alright, so we'll get the swab now and get that testing started.
**Patient: **OK, that sounds great, thank you.
**Control: **Add differential diagnosis
