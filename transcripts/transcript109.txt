**Medical Student: **OK, good good. Um has he had any sick contacts recently?
**Patient: **Um I don't think so. He's, we've been at home so I don't know. We we did have like, with our with my brother's uh kids like uh they came to see us once um but that was like, that was, I think at like three weeks ago.
**Medical Student: **OK, OK, three weeks ago. Alright, um travel to anywhere recently?
**Patient: **No.
**Medical Student: **No, OK. Alright, those were all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions that you wanted to ask me today before we end the interview?
**Patient: **Uh no, not really. Just wanted to know if, like I remember he did need antibiotics before so I was just wondering if he needs them now.
**Medical Student: **Yeah, um so, well first, because some of his symptoms overlap with Covid, like the fever especially, we'll do a swab on him anyways um and you should hear those results in about 24 to 48 hours. Um and then it, this picture sounds like acute otitis media, so like an ear infection. And um it's especially likely because he's had them in the past, so I'm gonna have to take a look into his ears first before like um coming up with a management plan. But I'll kind of walk you through what we look at. So if I take a look and I see like a perforated tympanic membrane with like pus, we'd prescribe like 10 days of um antibiotics. If he has some like middle ear effusion, so like some fluids with like a bulging tympanic membrane and he appears to be really ill, uh which from the sounds of it, he sounds ill, he's had this fever for more than two days, we'll also prescribe antibiotics for 10 days. And then, if it's just some middle ear effusion, so just that clear fluid um or just the bulging tympanic membrane, we can just um reassess him in 24 to 48 hours to see how he's doing. And if he's worse, again, we'll prescribing prescribe him some antibiotics. Um the antibiotics that we usually prescribe are amoxicillin, and because he doesn't have a penicillin allergy, that should work.
**Patient: **OK.
**Medical Student: **Yeah, how does that sound?
**Patient: **That sounds good. Thank you so much.
**Control: **Add differential diagnosis
