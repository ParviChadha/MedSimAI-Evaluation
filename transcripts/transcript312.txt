**Medical Student: **OK, and uhm, are you, uhm, are you currently smoking or have you ever smoked in the past?

**Medical Student: **OK. Also I just want to remind you that these questions will remain confidential between you and me. In case you're worried, no one's going to find out about what we're talking about unless you, unless there's concern about harm to you or harm to anyone else. Do you feel safe at home?
**Patient: **I do, yes.
**Medical Student: **OK, are things going well at school? Any bullying? Are you happy with your grades?

**Patient: **No, I'm not.
**Medical Student: **OK. Uhm, alright, have you had contact with anyone who might be sick?
**Patient: **I don't think so. I mean, going to, we both I mean, we've been going back to school recently, but nobody's been off.
**Medical Student: **OK. So you've been doing schooling in person, then, OK.
**Patient: **Yeah.
**Medical Student: **Alright. Any medical conditions that run in your family, anything related to the lungs, or otherwise?
**Patient: **Uh, no.
**Medical Student: **OK, uhm, alright, well those are all the questions I had for you. So it sounds like last week you had itchy eyes runny nose, you were sneezing and you had a dry cough. And then over time some of those symptoms resolved and you continued to have a cough that was also getting better, but you then developed a sore throat. And you have been feeling feverish over the past two days. Did you measure, did you check your temperature last week?
**Patient: **I didn't check it last week, but I checked it yesterday and it was 38.2, I think.
**Medical Student: **OK.
**Patient: **But yeah, but but those are the symptoms that that I've been having.
**Medical Student: **Uhm, so it sounds like you your symptoms have evolved quite a bit over the past two weeks. It could have, it could be potentially that you had a viral infection initially and might you might have like a superimposed bacterial infection, but we don't know that for sure. Uhm, we, we'll do a physical exam. Have a listen to your chest, have a look inside your mouth, look at your throat. Uhm, we, uhm, I guess the original symptoms you had last week., uhm, were seem a little bit different. It could be pharyngitis, maybe what you have right now could potentially be pharyngitis with a sore throat and the fever that you've developed over the past three or four days. So, I'll definitely have a look inside your throat as well, and if necessary we could do a rapid strep test. Uhm, and we would also have to do a Covid test just in case, and I would recommend that you quarantine at home. The results should come out in the next 12 to 20 for 24 to 48 hours. Just self isolate, stay away from other family members and then you'll find out the results. If it's positive, someone will call you from public health and then let you know what to do.
**Patient: **OK, yeah, that sounds good.
**Medical Student: **Alright.
**Patient: **Thank you.
**Control: **Add differential diagnosis
