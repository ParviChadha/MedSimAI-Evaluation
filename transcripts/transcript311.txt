**Medical Student: **So what uh, brings you here today?
**Patient: **I am here with uh, with my daughter, who has just been having a cough for the past um, two weeks.
**Medical Student: **Okay, um, and can you describe the cough a little bit? Is it a dry cough or is she bringing anything up?
**Patient: **Um, it is a, it is a dry cough, um, but she just keeps coughing and coughing and, and then she just, you know, once she'll start coughing she just doesn't stop. And then um, there's been times when she just turns blue, she's coughing so much. Um, and then it just gets, gets better um, on its own. But yeah, it's a dry cough.
**Medical Student: **Okay, and um, what does the cough sound like? Is it like a harsh cough, a barky cough?
**Patient: **Um, it's just, she just makes this noise when she's like breathe, trying to take a breath in. It's, it's yeah.
**Medical Student: **Okay, is it kind of a wheeze?
**Patient: **Yeah, sure.
**Medical Student: **Okay. Um, and so there's episodes where she also turns blue?
**Patient: **When she's coughing a lot, yeah, she does.
**Medical Student: **Okay.
**Patient: **She's also vomited once or twice.
**Medical Student: **Oh, I see, okay. Um, any blood in the vomit? Or is she coughing up any blood?
**Patient: **No.
**Medical Student: **No, okay. Um, any, so this started two weeks ago, any kind of symptoms of runny nose or um, cold-like symptoms before then?
**Patient: **Yeah, yeah she did have a bit of a runny nose. It was just uh, watery, uh, since discharge. And at that time her cough, she had a cough as well. Um, but I thought it was, you know, it's nothing. It was just like another flu and it would get better, but then she just, the runny nose got better without, in a couple of days, but the cough stayed. And it got, got pretty worse, uh, it got worse.
**Medical Student: **Okay, um, other than the cough uh, any, any fevers or chills?
**Patient: **No, I don't think she's had fevers. I haven't checked, though.
**Medical Student: **Okay. And the cough is pretty constant, or is it, does it come and go?
**Patient: **Yeah, she just has these episodes where she just coughs and coughs and coughs, and then she'll either vomit or just turn blue, or just um, get better in a couple, couple minutes. This kind of comes and goes like that.
**Medical Student: **Okay. And is there anything that has helped her at all? Like any over the counter medications or anything like that?
**Patient: **I haven't tried anything, I'm just worried about, you know she's my first child and I don't know what to give her and what not to give her at this age. So I just decided to come in and not try anything over the counter.
**Medical Student: **Okay. Um, and so, has this happened before at all?
**Patient: **No.
**Medical Student: **No, this is the first time, okay. Um, any so, she, she is vomiting. Um, is the vomit like green in colour? Or is she just vomiting up what she has eaten? What's the content of the moment?
**Patient: **It's usually just what she's eaten.
**Medical Student: **Okay, um, any sick contacts recently or any travel?
**Patient: **No, I don't think so. Not, nothing really.
**Medical Student: **Um, and how about her behaviour? Does she seem like uh, very tired or fatigued, or more irritable?
**Patient: **She does get tired, especially after, and then she's irritable and crying after, you know, she has these fits of coughs.
**Medical Student: **Okay.
**Patient: **Yeah.
**Medical Student: **Okay. Um, any symptoms of diarrhea or constipation?
**Patient: **No.
**Medical Student: **Okay. Any um, any trouble with urinating at all?
**Patient: **No.
**Medical Student: **No. How's her sleeping like?
**Patient: **Uh, not great. It's just the cough keeps uh, waking her up and she just doesn't, can't fall asleep.
**Medical Student: **Okay, any uh, exposure to dust or fumes, or animals or pets at home?
**Patient: **We, we did get a cat um, about a month ago.
**Medical Student: **Okay. Um, and any, has she been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
**Patient: **No.
**Medical Student: **Um, and any allergies that you know of?
**Patient: **Um, no.
**Medical Student: **And um, any previous hospitalizations or surgeries?
**Patient: **No.
**Medical Student: **And how was your pregnancy, your pregnancy with her, like any complications at all?
**Patient: **No, no complications. It was uh, it was very, yeah, it went well.
**Medical Student: **And was she at term or premature?
**Patient: **She was at term, she was born at term.
**Medical Student: **Was it a vaginal delivery or uh, a c-section?
**Patient: **Uh, vaginal.
**Medical Student: **And did she have to stay in the NICU at all, at the hospital afterwards?
**Patient: **No.
**Medical Student: **Okay. And is she feeding well, like what does she usually eat?
**Patient: **She's feeding well. She's doing uh, she eats everything, yeah.
**Medical Student: **Um, and any family history of any medical conditions?
**Patient: **No.
**Medical Student: **Um, and does anyone smoke in the house?
**Patient: **Um, her dad, but he, he doesn't smoke in front of her.
**Medical Student: **And what's her living situation like? Who does she live with? And do you live in a house, apartment?
**Patient: **Oh yeah, we live in an apartment. It's uh, me, my partner, her and the cat.
**Medical Student: **Okay. And any difficulties or complications with her growth? Like in terms of her weight or her height?
**Patient: **No, no complications. She's doing okay.
**Medical Student: **Okay. And in terms of her milestones, has she been meeting all of them on time?
**Patient: **Yes.
**Medical Student: **Okay. Alright, so I think those are all the questions I have for you today. Do you have any questions or concerns?
**Patient: **Uh, no.
**Medical Student: **Yeah, so based on the symptoms, oh yeah, sorry I forgot to ask one other question. Has she, are her immunizations all up to date?
**Patient: **Oh no, no. I don't, I don't get those. My friend's, my friend's daughter developed autism and I'm just, I don't want that, you know, so no. I don't vaccinate my kids. Or I don't vaccinate my daughter and I haven't been. Yeah, uh no, I won't be doing that.
**Medical Student: **And have you been vaccinated throughout your life?
**Patient: **Um, maybe when I was young, but I, yeah I don't, I just don't believe in vaccinations. I, yeah, no, I don't, I don't get those.
**Medical Student: **Yeah, so there is definitely uh, there's a lot of research done beside, behind vaccinations and a lot of prevention goes into them, but definitely there is some anecdotal evidence of very loose associations to autism that have been found to be invalid and like they have been invalidated by the research. So definitely, it's very important to get your child vaccinated. In fact, the sum of the symptoms that your child may be having right now can be caused by something called pertussis, and um, there's usually a vaccination for that. Like after pregnancy as well, so that's something that is definitely on the differential, and at this time we definitely need to make sure she's okay and get her vitals done, see her oxygenation saturation, and just do supportive care while she's in the hospital, and we may need to admit her, but we'll do the full physical examination today, get a COVID swab done as well. And usually it, she's currently in the, it seems to be the second phase, where she's vomiting and coughing a lot, and then it usually, after that phase, two or three more weeks of just coughing. And so, we're going to do some supportive care for her right now, but yeah, definitely, you should consider vaccinating your child. We recommend that to every parent as there's a lot of diseases out there that can be completely prevented if you vaccinate your child.
**Patient: **Okay, I'll think about it.
**Medical Student: **Alright, so, so for now we're gonna just make sure that she's doing well, okay?
**Patient: **Sure.
**Control: **Add differential diagnosis
