**Medical Student: **OK, did you actually take your temperature or do you just feel hot?
**Patient: **I just got hot.
**Medical Student: **OK so we can take your temperature today. Any chest pain?
**Patient: **No chest pain.
**Medical Student: **OK, and any throat pain?

**Medical Student: **OK, so it's your cough and just in general how you feel. Does it get better or worse with anything? Have you tried you know Tylenol and any antipyretics?
**Patient: **Yeah, I tried some uh like day and night time Tylenol at home to sleep but still, when I woke up in the morning, still not feeling very good and the cough is still here too.
**Medical Student: **OK, yeah. Have you ever experienced anything like this before?
**Patient: **Maybe as a kid. I mean, I remember getting the flu. I had a cough and that sort of thing, but I haven't been sick for several years now.
**Medical Student: **OK. Umm, and then since you started having this cough too, now has anything changed? How are you feeling worse? Or do you feel kind of the same as when it started?
**Patient: **I would say I feel a bit worse.
**Medical Student: **OK, and has anyone around you been sick recently?
**Patient: **Umm, no, not that I know of. Yeah, everybody in the house has been OK.
**Medical Student: **OK, have you traveled anywhere recently?
**Patient: **Umm, yeah, I was visiting some cousins up North several weeks ago, but that was just traveling within the province.
**Medical Student: **OK, and they're fine? No one is sick?
**Patient: **I haven't heard of anybody being sick.
**Medical Student: **OK, and are you otherwise healthy? Do you have any medical conditions?
**Patient: **I've been told I had high cholesterol before. But I don't take any medications for it. I've been just trying to lose some weight and exercise more.
**Medical Student: **Sure, OK. No surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
**Patient: **No.
**Medical Student: **OK and no other medications?
**Patient: **Umm, no,  I just take a multivitamin.
**Medical Student: **Ok, and no other you know over the counter medications or herbal stuff?
**Patient: **No, I'll use my Tylenol or Ibuprofen or Advil I guess if I get the occasional headache.  And I guess, umm, something like Reactine or Claritin for the seasonal allergies but that's about it.
**Medical Student: **OK. And so you said seasonal allergies. Any other allergies?
**Patient: **Umm, no, just usually like in the springtime.
**Medical Student: **OK, and are you up to date with all your immunizations?
**Patient: **Yeah I am. Yeah I get the flu shot every year.
**Medical Student: **OK good. And in terms of family history, do any of your family members have lung conditions or heart conditions?
**Patient: **I know mom has high blood pressure, but nobody's had a heart attack or, uh, no lung conditions either.
**Medical Student: **OK, any cancers that run in the family?
**Patient: **Umm, none, I can't think of any.
**Medical Student: **OK, and then do you smoke?
**Patient: **I just I smoke cannabis every once in awhile.
**Medical Student: **OK, how much do you smoke?
**Patient: **Um, I would say maybe, I enjoy it on the weekends.
**Medical Student: **Did you say a joint on the weekends?
**Patient: **Yes.
**Medical Student: **OK, so is that like 1 milligram?
**Patient: **Yeah, I would say something about that. Yeah, it's not much.
**Medical Student: **OK. But no cigarettes though?
**Patient: **No.
**Medical Student: **OK, any other recreational drugs?
**Patient: **No.
**Medical Student: **OK, and do you drink alcohol?
**Patient: **Umm, I do, yeah, I'll have like two or three beers on the weekend.
**Medical Student: **Sure. And and where do you live?
**Patient: **I'm just like 20 minutes down the road in a house here.
**Medical Student: **Sure, is it an apartment complex or is it like a full house?
**Patient: **Yeah, it's a single family home. I live there with my wife and three kids.
**Medical Student: **OK, um any concerns with your living arrangements you know, like old carpets or anything like that?
**Patient: **Actually last year we had most of the carpets taken out, so not anymore.
**Medical Student: **OK good good. Did you have any other questions or concerns? Anything that you wanted to bring up that I didn't touch on today?
**Patient: **Yeah, I was just really worried that this could be COVID. I mean I have a cough and just have been feeling really hot so I was just concerned about that.
**Medical Student: **Yeah, for sure, and I think that's a valid concern. So right now I'm just going through, you know, a list of differential diagnoses that you could possibly have and COVID, it's definitely top on my list and so we will likely get a swab and run those tests and try to get that back to you as soon as we can. It could also be other respiratory infections, especially viral infections this time of the year. And so, if it comes back negative for COVID, it's probably you know something else like respiratory virus or even the flu. So we'll go from there. And if it turns out it's not a viral infection, we will likely see if it's some sort of bacterial infection in which we can prescribe antibiotics for those. But it definitely sounds like there's an infectious picture going on here because of the acuteness of the presentation, and just your symptoms. So we will do afollow up in a week or so. Until then, we will run all these labs. Does that sound good?
**Patient: **Alright, yeah, that sounds good, so I guess I will kind of self isolate until the COVID results come back.
**Medical Student: **Oh yes please do so. That's that's a great point. I do suggest isolating for two weeks at least if you have any sort of symptoms, because even though the PCR that we do to test for COVID is supposed to be reliable and it's supposed to be specific and sensitive, there are sometimes false negative tests. You know, just to be on the safe side, if you're experiencing any of the symptoms that overlap with COVID symptoms, isolate for two weeks. But by the end of the week we should know what the test results are and then you will know for sure what you have.
**Patient: **OK, awesome, thank you.
**Control: **Add differential diagnosis
