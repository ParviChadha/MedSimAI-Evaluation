**Medical Student: **So what brings you in?
**Patient: **OK, I'm so I have been coughing a lot over the past week or so. And it's been pretty dry, but I've been coughing like almost nonstop throughout the day, and I'm feeling very short of breath, and my bronchodilator helps, but I found I'm using it a lot now.
**Medical Student: **OK, how long have you know that you have asthma for?
**Patient: **I was diagnosed when I was eight.
**Medical Student: **You're 10 now.
**Patient: **That's right.
**Medical Student: **So you're using your bronchodilator more. This is the one that you use, kind of as needed?
**Patient: **Yeah.
**Medical Student: **OK and then do you have one that you take every day no matter what?
**Patient: **Uhm? No, I don't have that one.

**Patient: **Uh no I don't take anything else.
**Medical Student: **Just the one is it a it's a puffer?
**Patient: **Yes.
**Medical Student: **OK, and you're using it more than normal, so how often were you normally using it?
**Patient: **Um I was only using it like I don't know. Maybe once every two weeks or so. Not very often. But now I'm using it like almost everyday like five six times a week.
**Medical Student: **OK, any are you? Does it usually turned out that you need it like during certain times like say when you're exercising or when it's cold?
**Patient: **Um I find I use it more, both like when it when it's right after I like, run around after gym during recess. Um and yeah, the cold also makes it worse.
**Medical Student: **OK, any other triggers that you can think of?
**Patient: **No, no other triggers.
**Medical Student: **Normally get more in certain seasons?

**Medical Student: **OK, so you have allergies too?
**Patient: **I think, so I haven't ever been like formally diagnosed.

**Patient: **Oh I'm I like playing games online with my friends and and before covid we used to get together and have movie nights and play sports together.
**Medical Student: **It sounds really cool. Hopefully we can get this figured out for you so you don't have any, you don't have to use your your medications every time you play sports 'cause that's no fun. And
**Patient: **No.
**Medical Student: **You should be able to enjoy that. So, so we're going to try to get this sorted out for you. I'm gonna go talk to the doctor and tell him everything or her everything that you said and yeah weâ€™ll come back and see you shortly, hopefully maybe all you need is a little change to your medications and maybe it will be better be able to better control your asthma.
**Patient: **Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you.
