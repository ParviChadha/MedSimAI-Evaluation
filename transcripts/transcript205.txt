**Medical Student: **Do you want to tell me what brought you in today?
**Patient: **Yeah, so for the past two days I I've I've noticed that I can't smell things as well, as I used to be able to smell them and I seem to have lost my sense of taste as well. And I have this mild dry cough. I'm just worried it's covid.
**Medical Student: **OK. You said for a couple days?
**Patient: **Yes, for two days.
**Medical Student: **OK, have you ever had anything like this before?
**Patient: **No, no, nothing like this.
**Medical Student: **OK, when you say you feel like you've lost sense of taste and smell, is it totally gone or do you taste a little bit? Or how? How is that working for you?
**Patient: **The smell isn't totally gone I can still smell something if it smells really really bad and and then and then I can taste really, really salty foods, but I can taste normal things like I can't taste of banana.
**Medical Student: **OK, is that been pretty consistent throughout the last couple of days or is it on and off?

**Medical Student: **So you haven't really been out of the house?
**Patient: **No.
**Medical Student: **OK. OK. Uhm I think that's all my questions for now. Uh I definitely like to get you a covid test just because your symptoms are consistent with some common covid symptoms. So basically that means that we would do a swab. It might not come back for a day or two. You definitely have to self isolate between now and when you get the results back, potentially even if it's negative, longer, if you're still having symptoms.
**Patient: **Yeah.
**Medical Student: **Otherwise, there probably. There might be a couple other tests we want to do. We might have more questions when we come back, we'll go over this with the doctor that I'm working with today, but just wanted to give you a heads up of what to expect next. Did you have anything else you wanted to tell me that I didn't ask you about or any questions?
**Patient: **No, uh thank you so much.
**Medical Student: **OK, well thanks for coming in today. Will definitely get you taken care of shortly.
**Patient: **Thank you.
**Control: **Add differential diagnosis
