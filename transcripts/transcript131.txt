**Medical Student: **OK, good and have you traveled to anywhere recently?
**Patient: **No, we've been pretty homebound.
**Medical Student: **Pretty homebound, OK, alright, well that's good and those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions for myself?
**Patient: **Yeah, I don't know, what do you think is causing all of this?
**Medical Student: **Yeah, it sounds like you have some sort of infection, so the first thing we need to rule out is covid, of course. So we'll do a swab and those swabs should come back to you in about 24 to 48 hours and until then, it's important that you do isolate and you isolate for 14 days at least, and that includes from other people at home. And if those swabs come back negative, you could possibly have like, another infection. But if your symptoms worsen, like you start getting neurological deficits like weakness or seizures or anything like that, you should come back to the ER and we'll get that checked out. And, so that's where we'll start for now, because your presentation is acute, we think it's likely infection related.
**Patient: **OK, that sounds good to me and should I be staying in my own room or anything like that at home?
**Medical Student: **Yeah, if you can like, it's recommended that you try to isolate in your own room for the next 14 days because your symptoms do overlap with that of covid, yeah.
**Patient: **OK, sounds good.Thank you.
**Medical Student: **Yeah, no worries, take care.
**Control: **Add differential diagnosis
