**Medical Student: **So what brings you in here to the ER?
**Patient: **Well, I thought I should start by saying I was recently hospitalised for pneumonia. I left five days ago, but as soon as I left that evening, I started coughing again and now I have all the same symptoms. I have a cough, I'm feeling short of breath and I have a feeling like I have a fever.
**Medical Student: **OK, and before you were discharged the day, can you let me know what you had and what kind of things were you treated with?
**Patient: **I was treated with some antibiotics, I don't know exactly which ones. They said I had some sort of bacterial pneumonia.
**Medical Student: **OK. But then it got resolved and they sent you home?
**Patient: **Yeah, that's right.
**Medical Student: **So are your symptoms similar to when you got admitted?
**Patient: **They are similar, but I feel like they are also worse now.
**Medical Student: **OK, worse, OK, so you're having a cough, shortness of breath and fever, and did that all start together? Or did one come before another?
**Patient: **Um, so the cough came first, then the shortness of breath, and then the fever.

**Patient: **Um, maybe like, 10 to 15 times in a day I produce enough to fill like the inside of my palm.
**Medical Student: **OK. And with the fever, did you get a chance to measure, take a temperature at all?

**Patient: **No.
**Medical Student: **OK. Yeah, so is there anything else? Any other questions that you have for me today?
**Patient: **No, what do you think I have?
**Medical Student: **Yeah, so there's definitely multiple things that can be going on. Since you were just recently admitted, maybe you might have another bacterial r espiratory infection, like a pneumonia or it could be viral as well. So the first thing we want to do is for sure get COVID swab done and then we will also get, since you were admitted, as well recently, we want to get an X Ray on you just to see if there's any pneumonia. OK, and so we'll be keeping you here for a bit until everything comes back. We'll get some blood work done for you as well to see if there's any infection in your body. And then yeah, so just sit tight, we'll get all those things done. Is that OK with you?
**Patient: **Yeah, that's great. Thank you.
**Medical Student: **You're welcome, yeah. So well will be updating you shortly.
**Control: **Add differential diagnosis
