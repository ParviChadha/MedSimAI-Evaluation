**Medical Student: **Yeah, you're you're right. So for um, in Canada or anybody or in Ontario, at least, anybody who's older than 65, it's recommended to get this vaccine to protect against certain types of bacterial infections type which can cause pneumonia. So it would be good something that you can set up with your family doctor.

**Medical Student: **OK, and, I think that.. OK, and that was all I wanted to ask on history. Was there anything else that you wanted to tell me today?
**Patient: **Um, no, just um, what do you think the problem is? I've never felt this bad with my shortness of breath before.
**Medical Student: **Yeah, certainly so umm, it, it sounds like it could be maybe a viral infection that I brought on this cough and worsen the sputum. This could be a bacterial infection, it could be a COPD exacerbation and also one of the other things that we would have to consider right now is Covid as well and so we will do a PCR nasal swab for Covid and a chest Xx-ray and some other investigations as well and uhm, we will try to get to the bottom of what's causing your your shortness of breath.
