**Patient: **I do.
**Medical Student: **OK, so for one of the Ontario stores?
**Patient: **Yes.
**Medical Student: **OK great yeah 'cause you could never be sure where else, what the dosing is, so it's good to get it from the appropriate stores for sure.
**Patient: **Right.
**Medical Student: **Do you drink alcohol?
**Patient: **I do, I'll have a glass of wine with dinner.
**Medical Student: **OK is this daily?
**Patient: **Um most days I would say, maybe like four or five days of the seven days of the week.
**Medical Student: **OK, I see. And has anybody in your family had similar symptoms in the past to what you're having or had any lung conditions in the past?
**Patient: **No, nothing like that.
**Medical Student: **OK, how about any heart conditions?
**Patient: **Um, my father passed away at 75 from a heart attack.
**Medical Student: **OK, and uh, how about any cancers in the family?
**Patient: **None that I know of.
**Medical Student: **OK. So I think that was, uh, all of the questions that I wanted to ask on history today. Was there anything else that you thought I was missing or that you wanted to tell me about?
**Patient: **No, I don't think so. But, uh, what do you think I have?
**Medical Student: **So with the acuity of your symptoms, starting with the last few days and getting worse, especially with a fever which we now have documented of 38.8 and a kind of feeling, uh, tired with aches and pains and the headache, I am concerned that you have possibly a viral infection, and one of those possibilities could be COVID-19, but also it could be the influenza. It could be something like the common cold, such as adenovirus. So certainly we will do a PCR COVID swab as well as order some general lab work to look for signs of infection, such as a CBC and a white blood cell count. But um, for now we will get those tests ordered. Did you have any questions?
**Patient: **OK yeah that sounds great. Do you think I could also have you know, meningitis or something? 'Cause I was reading online on Google and that's the first thing that came up.
**Medical Student: **Oh yeah, you're you're absolutely right, so, um sorry, I we will go ahead and investigate that as well and we might need to do a lumbar puncture or some blood work to look for signs of infection that might be needed to be treated with antibiotics.
**Control: **Add differential diagnosis
