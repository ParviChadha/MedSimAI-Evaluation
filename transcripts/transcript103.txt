**Patient: **No.
**Medical Student: **OK, so yeah, it seems like you've been having these symptoms for the last few days. They seem kind of like viral in nature with your dry cough and runny nose, sore throat. And sometimes with these viral illnesses, it may take some time for the symptoms to go away, especially the cough. So today we will do a COVID swab test for you today, as a lot of the symptoms overlap and you will receive the result in the next one to two days and be contacted by public health for further instructions. As for management, I think you can take over the counter medications like Tylenol cold, drink lots of fluids and stay hydrated. And if those if your symptoms worsen at all, you can contact us again.
**Patient: **Sure, thank you.
**Control: **Add differential diagnosis
