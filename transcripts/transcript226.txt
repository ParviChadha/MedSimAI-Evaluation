**Medical Student: **So what brings you in here today?
**Patient: **So I've had this stuffy nose for the past three days. I'm getting some yellow discharge from the nose. I can't seem to smell well. And I have had this terrible headache for the past two days as well.
**Medical Student: **OK, so just to kind of get a timeline, what kind of started first?
**Patient: **So first, my nose was kind of stuffy. And and then I started having this yellow discharge from the nose and then I kind of lost some of my smell. And then now my head hurts. It's not even like, it's not like a headache, it's like a facial pressure
**Medical Student: **OK. And have you had any of these symptoms before?
**Patient: **No, never.
**Medical Student: **OK. Alright, have you noticed...so you said like the discharge is yellow, how much of the discharge are you having like in a day?
**Patient: **Like probably enough to fill the inside of my palm.
**Medical Student: **OK, and have you been having any fevers or chills?
**Patient: **Uh, no,  nothing like that. I did have what they thought was a viral infection a week back.

**Patient: **Yeah, now that you mention it, it does feel like that.
**Medical Student: **OK, and have you noticed at all or has someone told you that your breath might smell bad? Or have you noticed it yourself?

**Medical Student: **OK, is there anything that helps you at all that you've tried?
**Patient: **Like just the positions of how I'm sleeping sometimes helps, yeah.
**Medical Student: **OK, so this has been going on for, just remind me again, like the last four day?

**Medical Student: **Ok, a joint or two, OK. And is that, is that just recreationally or has it been helping at all with your symptoms?
**Patient: **Uh, that's just recreationally.
**Medical Student: **OK. Alright, yeah, so those are all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions at all for me?
**Patient: **Uh, no, what was like, what do you think I have?
**Medical Student: **Yeah, so from the symptoms that you're describing, it does seem more like sinus issues. There's a sinus behind your face and what can happen is if you get an infection, like all the the mucous and everything can build up and increase the pressure. That's the pressure you're feeling underneath your face.  It's because of a sinus infection most likely. And usually like, it's usually like a viral infection that can go away on its own. We usually ask patients to try the nasal rinses, and then some oral decongestents. Or have you tried any anti histamines?
**Patient: **No, I haven't.
**Medical Student: **OK, so no antihistamines. It seems most likely that you have a sinus infection. It can be bacterial with the yellow discharge that you're having as well. So we can give you some antibiotics, so will give you some. Amoxicillin.
**Patient: **Sure.
**Medical Student: **So it's only been three day since you're having these symptoms, right?  And you haven't had any high fever or anything like that? Have you measured your temperature?
**Patient: **I haven't, I haven't, no.
**Medical Student: **OK.
**Patient: **I don't feel hot though.
**Medical Student: **OK, since it's been three days, what I'm going to do is still give you some antibiotics so Amoxicillin and then we'll see like after you finish that dose how you feel. And will set up another appointment for when we can do like a phone appointment and or clinic appointment when your doses are done. Does that sound good?
**Patient: **Yeah that sounds great. Thank you.
**Medical Student: **OK, you're welcome and hopefully you feel better.
**Patient: **Thank you.
**Medical Student: **Take care.
**Control: **Add differential diagnosis
