**Medical Student: **Okay, and um, as she had a fever the entire time over the past three or four days.
**Patient: **Yeah, I would say so like it's come and gone, but every time I checked her temperature, I tried to check her twice a day, it would be pretty high, like 38 or uh, 39.
**Medical Student: **Okay, so it was between 38 and 39 each time you checked it.
**Patient: **Yeah, and now I should mention like um, I checked today and she didn't have a fever today, but she sounds really wheezy now.
**Medical Student: **Okay, is the wheeze new today?
**Patient: **Uh yeah.
**Medical Student: **Okay, um, and the cough, that started about three or four days ago as well?

**Patient: **No, nothing like that.
**Medical Student: **Okay, um, and family history of any cancer?
**Patient: **No.
**Medical Student: **Okay. Um, so were there any other um, so that was everything that I wanted to ask today before I went on to the physical exam. Um, was there anything else that you, that you wanted to add or were wondering about that I maybe forgot to ask?
**Patient: **Yeah um, what, what can we do for her um, to make her better? And are you concerned about her breathing?
**Medical Student: **Um, so the, the physical exam and the, the vital signs will really, will help with um, to assess her breathing and to see oxygen levels.
**Patient: **Yeah.
**Medical Student: **Um, and um, this could be uh, caused by um, a viral infection, which could be something along the lines of uh, like a common cold type picture, and we can get like inflammation of uh, really small airways, um, and it can cause that cough, and fever, and some of the symptoms that she's experiencing. And also, um, these symptoms do overlap with COVID as well, um, and so it'll be important to get a COVID swab just in case. Um, but um, if that is the, the scenario, then it will be um, supportive care with oxygen, fluids and we'll make sure that um, that her, her breathing is uh, okay. And possibly, we'll need steroids and um, and uh, an inhaler if necessary.
