**Medical Student: **What brings you in today?
**Patient: **So I so I have COPD and it's usually like pretty manageable with my puffers and that. But just in the last like 3 days I feel like it's gotten a lot worse. You know, I, I feel like I'm coughing more often and I'm now, uh, kind of producing more sputum. Kind of like a green yellowy sputum uhm. I even notice that there is like a little bit of blood a couple times when I was like, really coughing hard. I’ve been finding it like harder to breathe than usual. I don’t have home oxygen or anything, and I'm not. I didn't think I was quite there yet, but this these last few days it's been. It's been really hard to breathe.
**Medical Student: **I see OK, so this is happened in the past three days. Have your symptoms gotten better or worse over this time?
**Patient: **I feel like they've been get maybe maybe getting a little worse. They definitely haven't gotten better,
**Medical Student: **OK, and has this ever happened to you before?
**Patient: **I’ve had I had some troubles like when I've been sick before where the cough is gotten pretty bad. This is probably this is probably the worst that I've had, but I have like I have had in my COPD been made worse by being sick.
**Medical Student: **I see OK. Well, I guess the first thing we're going. So how's tbad, how bad is your shortness of breath?
**Patient: **Like I I walked here fine, but I normally like can walk around the block and I go for a walk, usually a couple times a day to walk my dog and it's been just it's been a little bit trickier to do that.
**Medical Student: **I see OK. And uh have you ever had any hospitalizations in the past specifically for COPD exacerbations?
**Patient: **Um I haven't. Uhm, like stayed over in the hospital. I like come to emerge a couple times.

**Patient: **Here by the bed. I would say had a fever.
**Medical Student: **Sure. And. Have you had any other symptoms? So have you had like a runny nose or stuffy nose? Any pain in your sinus?

**Patient: **Um. Let me think I I meet my I meet a couple of friends to walk our dogs together outside and one of them was a bit sick for a bit. We try not to get too close, but maybe I don't know. Maybe sometimes we walk a little too close. We feel too safe 'cause we're like outside.
**Medical Student: **OK, OK um. And did your friend get a covid test done?

**Patient: **Um. Yeah I have a high blood pressure.
**Medical Student: **OK, and are you taking any medications?
**Patient: **I’m not, I'm not I we talked about it, but I decided to try to change my lifestyle as much as I could 1st and I've also done that for the COPD. It's generally pretty like I've been really trying to take care of it, but um I feel like I maybe got sick or something this time, yeah, so my blood pressure is like OK right now.
**Medical Student: **OK, OK.
**Patient: **My pressure and then I lost weight and started this walking more.
**Medical Student: **That's great. That's really, really good that you're taking better care of yourself. Should definitely continue doing that.
**Patient: **Right?
**Medical Student: **And you've mentioned that you have some puffers. How often do you use those?
**Patient: **Oh like I have the one that I use every day. That I'm supposed to just use no matter what, and then the one that I use when kind of just when I need it. I probably use it like once every two weeks.
**Medical Student: **OK. OK. Uhm? And you mentioned that your COPD’s are getting better. Do you find that it's affecting your life in any way affecting the way that you're doing your daily activities at at home or at work, if you are working?

**Patient: **No.
**Medical Student: **You, I guess I should have asked you earlier, but have you noticed any change in your sense of smell?

**Medical Student: **And do you drink alcohol?
**Patient: **Oh, very rarely .
**Medical Student: **OK do you smoke?
**Patient: **I used to. I quit once they said I have COPD. I smoked 1/2 pack a day for probably 20 years.
**Medical Student: **OK, OK, and do you consume marijuana or any recreational drugs?
**Patient: **No.
**Medical Student: **OK, uh, alright, well I guess one more question, are there any lung diseases or heart conditions or cancers that run in the family?
**Patient: **No, nothing that I can think of.
**Medical Student: **Alright, well that's those are all the questions I had for you. I will now do it physical exam and look at your vitals and listen to your chest. It's likely that what you have right now is COPD exacerbation, maybe just a like an infection that you got, which worsened some of your COPD symptoms. We would also have to rule out covid, so we'll be doing a covid swab and will decide based on the on your labs in your vital signs. It's instead of other things whether you need to stay in the ER and be admitted, or if you are good to go home, I will also talk to my attending and will make those decisions together and come back and talk to you. Does that sound good to you?
**Patient: **Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you.
**Control: **Add differential diagnosis
