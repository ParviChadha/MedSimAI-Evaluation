**Medical Student: **Yeah yeah but also even if you try to cut down some of your symptoms might get better. Like even though you're 75, you can definitely have improvement in some of your symptoms that you're having, like the shortness of breath and coughing. So if at all that you you want to consider cutting down and gradually. we can talk about that more as well.
**Patient: **Sure

**Patient: **No
**Medical Student: **No, OK, so yeah, those are all the questions I have for you. Do you have any questions for me?
**Patient: **No, I just I guess I need to be admitted right? Just like those other COPD exacerbations? I'm thinking this is exactly that and I'll have to stay in the hospital, right? for a couple of days
**Medical Student: **Yeah, so we definitely before deciding on whether or not you should be admitted, since you said the Ventolin is not working for you, we will definitely give you some some ventilation and perhaps steroid for just to get rid of some of your symptoms right now, and we want to also make sure since you're having like cough as well as shortness of breath to do a covid swab on you, just in case. I know you've been like isolating and everything, but just in case I will do that and we'll get like a chest x ray on you as well, just to see if there's any kind of pneumonia going on. And then from there we'll also get your blood work, and then from there we'll see whether or not you will require another admission.
**Patient: **Sure.
**Medical Student: **OK, and there you might, I'm not 100% sure, but you might require home oxygen if like we take your vitals and everything and your oxygenation is very low. Have you have you been talked about that at all in the past?
**Patient: **Yeah, they talked about it last time I've been trying to avoid it, but if it has to happen, it has to happen.
**Medical Student: **Hmm yeah, and it might just sometimes just, you know you've had four admissions in the past and it might actually just help you stay at home if you are on oxygen. Anyways, yeah we can talk about that. We'll do like a full physical examination everything and go from there.
**Patient: **Sure.
**Control: **Add differential diagnosis
