**Medical Student: **What brings you in here today?
**Patient: **I just started having, um, difficulty with breathing um, starting yesterday. And I also developed this cough um, yesterday morning.
**Medical Student: **Okay, so did, did the cough come first or the breathing, difficulty breathing?
**Patient: **Kind of around the same time when I woke up in the morning.
**Medical Student: **And did it wake you up from sleep at all? Like did you wake up trying to catch a breath or anything?
**Patient: **No.
**Medical Student: **Okay, so it happened after you had woken up and gotten out of bed. And um, so, can you describe your cough a little bit? Is it wet or is it dry?
**Patient: **Um, it's just um, it's just a dry cough.
**Medical Student: **Okay, you're not bringing up any sputum or any other material?
**Patient: **No.
**Medical Student: **And uh, are you coughing up any blood by any chance?
**Patient: **No.
**Medical Student: **For the shortness of breath, can you describe it a little bit? Is it, are you having trouble taking deep breaths, or are you breathing faster? Can you describe it?
**Patient: **Yeah, I just feel like um, I'm getting out of breath really easily, just like um, walking even, walking to the kitchen from my bedroom, I'm getting short of breath and it, it just started yesterday morning, it's so odd.
**Medical Student: **Okay, and have you had anything like this happen before to you?
**Patient: **No.
**Medical Student: **No. Were you doing anything before it started? Like were you doing any, any activities or any, are were you doing any exertions at all?
**Patient: **No, I was just uh, I, I slept in, I slept in a bit more than usual, um, and I was feeling quite um, drowsy. My, my doc increased my pain meds and I took the first dose um, yesterday night, um, I actually took an extra pill um, um, of the morphine um, and yeah, I don't know, maybe it, it's an allergic reaction to the morphine.
**Medical Student: **Have you had any allergic reactions before?
**Patient: **No.
**Medical Student: **And so you took an extra morphine last night and then went to sleep. Um, did you wake up coughing or catching your breath or anything like that?
**Patient: **No, I actually, I ended up waking up at 1:00 PM or 2:00 PM, I was just very drowsy and uh, I think I, I think I might have taken a bit too much, I don't know. The, the arthritis pain was just killing me last night and I thought taking an extra pill would help.
**Medical Student: **And is this, are your symptoms constant? Or do they come and go?
**Patient: **They're constant for the past two days. I've also noticed that I have, my breath just smells really bad. I don't know why.

**Patient: **I'm a banker, but I'm working virtually, uh, remotely right now.
**Medical Student: **Okay. And um, do you use any recreational drugs like marijuana?
**Patient: **I um, no. Well sometimes I'll use marijuana for the pain, but I haven't been doing that recently, for the past two months.
**Medical Student: **Okay. Um, how, how often would you say you use it?
**Patient: **Only when the pain gets uh, too bad, so maybe um, three or four times a month.
**Medical Student: **Okay, and do you use any alcohol?
**Patient: **Um, yeah, I'll, uh, I'll drink once a week, two glasses, two or three glasses of wine.
**Medical Student: **Um, any, alright, so I think that those are all the questions I have for you today. Do you have any questions or concerns for me?
**Patient: **Um, no.
**Medical Student: **Okay, so yeah, definitely with the coughing and shortness of breath we will definitely get a COVID swab test done. Um, that should come back in the next 24 to 48 hours and then public health will contact you. Um, yeah, based on what you're telling me so far, we will definitely do a physical examination, get your vitals, and get your oxygenation and everything done. But I also think, since you were very drowsy and were, had fallen asleep and were really difficult to wake up, sometimes you can get what's called aspiration pneumonia. Um, and that's, that can also be a possibility and what we will do is get a chest x-ray, get some blood work done as well today. Um, now we may require antibiotics, and if your vitals unstable we might actually admit you as well. Um, does that sound good?
**Patient: **Yeah.
**Medical Student: **Alright, so yeah, we'll get those tests done and we'll be there with you shortly. We'll also get like an EKG done as well.
**Patient: **Sure.
**Control: **Add differential diagnosis
