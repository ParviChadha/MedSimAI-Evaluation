**Medical Student: **What brings you in today?
**Patient: **This afternoon, I'm just here because I've been experiencing some breathlessness as well as a bit of cough.
**Medical Student: **OK, when did it start?
**Patient: **So I think it's a it started around three months ago and I believe it's just been getting worse.
**Medical Student: **OK. Um, how often are you experiencing the shortness of breath?
**Patient: **I feel it like a lot of the time, especially outside when I'm in the cold or at at night when I go outside at night, my chest feels a little tight too at the same time.
**Medical Student: **OK, and how long does it last?
**Patient: **I would say it lasts up to an hour every time I'm out in the cold and then once I come back in. So I'd say it lasts at least one hour.
**Medical Student: **OK, does anything else make it worse, like dust? You know, laying down anything like that?
**Patient: **Sometimes when I'm near dust, sometimes when I'm running during gym class, increased activity does make it worse.
**Medical Student: **OK, OK. And if you were to describe the quality of your breathing difficulties, is it more like a burning kind of feeling? Is it like you can't catch your breath? What does it feel like?
**Patient: **I think it's more just a I can't catch my breath and it feels like my my throat is just kind of like closing off and I can't take deep breaths.
**Medical Student: **OK, yeah, that's scary. And one to 10, 10 being the worst, how bad is your shortness of breath?
**Patient: **It can get up to I would say like an 8 at times. It can get pretty scary. And sometimes, like I feel like heaviness in my chest too when it happens.
**Medical Student: **Yeah, and the coughing, has it been going on for as long as your breathlessness?
**Patient: **I would say around the same same time frame like 3 months, but I'm not always coughing. It comes and goes.
**Medical Student: **OK, and for your coughing, is it kind of like the same triggers, the cold, dust, things like that?
**Patient: **Yeah, I would say so.
**Medical Student: **And do you ever have do you ever cough up blood?
**Patient: **No, I don't. It's mostly just a dry cough. I don't cough up anything.
**Medical Student: **OK so no sputum or phlegm, no? OK, do you ever feel wheezy?
**Patient: **I I I do hear like a like a weird sound when I breathe out sometimes, I I think it might be wheeziness.

**Patient: **No, nothing like that.
**Medical Student: **No? OK um, OK, how about um, does your shortness of breath get worse when you're falling asleep?

**Medical Student: **OK, um, any recent surgeries?
**Patient: **No.
**Medical Student: **No? Are you on any medications?

**Patient: **So I currently live in London, but I just recently moved into a new flat around two months ago.
**Medical Student: **Two months ago, OK. Um, is it more is it an older flat?
**Patient: **Uh, no, it's fairly new. But one thing I did notice, I don't know if this has anything to do with it, but my flatmate actually smokes. Sometimes that can really irritate and make me cough more sometimes at night.
**Medical Student: **Yeah, any any pets?
**Patient: **Oh no, I don't have any pets.
**Medical Student: **OK and and do you smoke?

**Patient: **No, I don't smoke marijuana or cigarettes.
**Medical Student: **OK, how about alcohol? Do you drink alcohol?
**Patient: **Um, just like, maybe sometimes at parties, but very rarely. Maybe I would say once a month.
**Medical Student: **OK, OK. Um, and is there anything that you wanted to discuss today that I missed?
**Patient: **Uh, so no, I think that that was all like just the shortness of breath was scaring me a lot. But yeah, just the coughing, but other than that I just want to know what's going on.
**Medical Student: **OK, yeah, and you mentioned you are otherwise healthy so you don't have any history of asthma or anything like that, right?
**Patient: **No, no ones ever told me that, but my sister has asthma, so I was wondering, maybe?
**Medical Student: **Um, have you ever experienced shortness of breath when you were younger with like exercise?
**Patient: **Uh, not really. Just maybe like the normal amount. Like if I'm running around too much, I feel shortness of breath, but I think it just got worse over the last few months.
**Medical Student: **OK and then have you ever had any imaging done in the past like a chest X-Ray or investigations like a pulmonary function test?
**Patient: **No, I don't recall having any of that done.
**Medical Student: **OK alright well those are all the questions I had for you. If you didn't have anything else to add, I guess we will conclude by saying that what you have, we have a differential diagnosis for this. Um, it sounds like what you have is asthma. Since your symptoms started three months ago when you moved into a flat with your friends, and it seems like this smoking and cold is triggering that and so we'll work you up with a pulmonary function test to start and we'll see if bronchodilators will help with your symptoms. And if it doesn't, we'll also rule out other things like pneumonia or like allergic rhinitis. How does that sound?
**Patient: **Yeah, that sounds good.
**Medical Student: **OK, sounds great. Well, we'll see you soon then.
**Patient: **Alright, thank you.
**Medical Student: **Take care.
**Control: **Add differential diagnosis
