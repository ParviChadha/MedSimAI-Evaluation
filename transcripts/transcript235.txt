**Patient: **Um No, I think you covered everything. Thank you.
**Medical Student: **OK yeah, no worries. So I guess at this point we would do a physical exam. Just take a listen to your lungs and your chest. After that, so right now it sounds like it could be something vascular you know, like a pulmonary embolism like we talked about. That's kind of high on my list of things to work up for. But also, we don't want to miss other things you know, like cancer, infection, autoimmune things that could affect your lungs, so we'll just do a work up for all of that. How does that sound?
**Patient: **Yeah, whatever, whatever you think we need to do.
**Medical Student: **OK sounds good. Thank you for your time.
**Control: **Add differential diagnosis
