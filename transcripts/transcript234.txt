**Patient: **Hi, um so I've had this terrible fever for the past three days um and just before that I had a stuffy nose um and I had a sore throat, well I still do, um and it's just not going away, so I thought I should just come in and see if I have covid or what it is.

**Medical Student: **Understood. And have you ever used IV drugs?
**Patient: **No.
**Medical Student: **OK, and when was your last menstrual period?
**Patient: **It was um a year ago.
**Medical Student: **A year ago?
**Patient: **Mhmm.
**Medical Student: **OK. And then otherwise, so we talked a little bit about recent travel. It sounds like you have the hiking trip last week and you passed some people, but it sounds like your husband also has kind of similar symptoms that you do right now.
**Patient: **Yeah.
**Medical Student: **Sounds good, now we've already talked about kind of past medical issues. Moving on, I think what we'll do next is move on to a physical exam. But before I do that, do you have any questions for me? Anything else you feel I should know?
**Patient: **No, do you think I have covid?
**Medical Student: **It's a possibility. It's always good to rule these things out, so we'll be ordering a covid swab no matter what. Obviously with any presentation where we have someone come in with a fever and sore throat, we want to rule out anything infectious. So it sounds like if your husband got it, and you have it, covid would be our first thing that we want to rule out. So just while we're trying to investigate, work this up further, I want to have you and your husband self isolate. The other question I suppose I should ask is, have you gotten your flu shot this year?
**Patient: **No, I haven't.
**Medical Student: **So it's also a possibility it might be influenza, just the seasonal flu. But until we, I suppose rule out covid, it'd be best just to keep to yourself just in case you are infectious for the meanwhile.
**Patient: **OK, sure.
**Medical Student: **Alright, well I'm going to go talk to the Doctor and I'll be coming back in to see you, OK?
**Patient: **Alright, great thank you.
**Control: **Add differential diagnosis
