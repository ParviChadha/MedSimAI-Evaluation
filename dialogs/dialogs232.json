And in the meantime, because your symptoms do overlap with COVID, you should isolate for 14 days. Public health will be in touch with you if it's positive to do some contact tracing. If it's not COVID, it could be another viral infection that's been going around during this time of year which is likely because you have COPD, since you're already coughing more than you usually are and seeing more sputum. We will reassess to see whether your puffers are working. If we need to add any additional things like inhaled corticosteroids as well as antibiotics and so just keep an eye on your symptoms for now and will also want to do probably a chest X Ray and possibly a pulmonary function test. How does that sound?",
