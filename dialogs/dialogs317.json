Um so we'll take a swab today, we'll send it off um for those PCR results, you should hear back in 24 to 48 hours. Uh in the meantime, you should isolate for 14 days, and that includes from family members when possible, and public health will get in touch with you if those results are positive and so they can they can do some contact tracing. If it's not Covid, it could be another viral illness that's going around, and I guess the best therapy for that is staying hydrated, um getting good sleep, and eating nutritious foods.
