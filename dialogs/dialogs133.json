And so we'll do a rapid strep antigen test and it will require just a throat swab. To see, to to detect for that, however with a, uh, umm, yeah, I guess that's it. That's what I yeah, well, we'll start with with that now and it could potentially be something like uhm, a viral illness, but that's lower on the on the differential then the bacterial infection is right now. And because of COVID it will be, we'll do a swab as well because people can get fever and sore throat with with COVID as well.",
