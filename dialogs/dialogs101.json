And so we will be getting a swab done for you as well today and considering you are having these symptoms, we will also get another test done for you today to see if there's any bacteria causing what we call walking pneumonia. It's community acquired pneumonia that's fairly common in like the younger population. And so we'll see if you could have that. And so from there we'll see if we need to put you on any antibiotics which will help you. And if we need to get any blood work or X Rays we'll let you know as well. Is that OK? And if you feel like you have worsening symptoms like shortness of breath, you need to make sure you come back to the Emergency Department.",
