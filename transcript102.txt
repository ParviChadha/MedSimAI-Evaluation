**Patient: **Nothing else right now.
**Medical Student: **OK. So yeah, based on her symptoms, she does seem to have some just a cold like symptoms, viral symptoms. And it's been, it's been you said three or four days in total, right?
**Patient: **Yeah yeah.
**Medical Student: **Yeah, and so most likely it's just caused by a viral infection like common cold perhaps, it she doesn't have any worrying signs of any systemic things going on right now, so and no signs of like a bacterial infection that I would be concerned about that I would give antibiotics for right now. But definitely if her symptoms get worse at home and if she starts having any kind of shortness of breath, increased coughing with producing, more yellow or green material and if she gets more feverish, so will also do a physical exam and take her temperature today as well. But yeah, some of these things you just look out for, but yeah, so that that we'll do the physical examination and go from there.
**Patient: **Alright, thank you.
**Control: **Add differential diagnosis
