Inorganic cause meaning something going on, otherwise just yet we might need to do some physical exam and some investigations first, but it certainly could be related to that.

**Medical Student: **OK. Anybody in in the family have problems with substance, substance use?
**Patient: **no.
**Medical Student: **OK. Um, and  I think that's everything that I I wanted to ask on history today. So you been having these episodes where you get really short of breath and you get chest pain, you'll get sweaty and have what sounds like what sounds like an impending sense of doom where you kind of feel like it's coming on and it lasts for 15 minutes and not related to exercise. Were there any other symptoms or things that you've been experiencing recently?
**Patient: **Yeah, it's also,  I also feel like my heart's like breathing really fast.
**Medical Student: **Oh, OK. And I does that, how long does it last for?
**Patient: **Same time. Like everything is just sort of comes on at the same time. Just kind of goes away together.
**Medical Student: **OK, would you say that it comes on like kind of like at the snap of your fingers sort of thing like really quickly and then?
**Patient: **I can kind of tell it's gonna come on like I have a sense of it and then it just like starts. It suddenly just happens.
**Medical Student: **OK. So you you have the heart racing, are there any other symptoms as well?
**Patient: **I don't think so.
**Medical Student: **OK, so, uh, we will get an ECG and  I will look at that, but I've been concerned now thinking that this might be related to anxiety or panic attacks and so, I guess that would be something that we could discuss more about in regards to like I guess previous traumas and things that and the stresses that you might be dealing with currently to help manage manage stress better.
