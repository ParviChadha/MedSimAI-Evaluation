**Patient: **I am yeah. So it's uh, yeah I work for this tech company so I've been able to do a lot of my stuff at at home.
**Medical Student: **OK, uhm. Have you had any exposures to anyone who could potentially be sick?
**Patient: **I will without, well, yeah I there a couple or last weekend. Actually there was a family party that we went to. It was outside, but uh, it, yeah, there's people around. There was nobody that was sick that I'm aware of.
**Medical Student: **OK. And and have you traveled anywhere outside the province?
**Patient: **No been besides that, the family party last weekend, but I mean that was just here in town so. It was close by.
**Medical Student: **OK, I guess I forgot to ask about a symptom. Have you felt that you've lost your sense of smell or sense of taste? Has it just been different?
**Patient: **Yeah, I said some actually now that you mention it right sense of smell has been different, which is kind of weird, 'cause I I don't have, everybody knows or I don't feel congested or anything. So yeah, but my taste has been OK.
**Medical Student: **Good. Well, that's all the questions I had for you. Given that your symptoms sort of sound like you may have a viral or bacterial infection and seeing that you were, you had some exposure to to other people even though they weren't sick, it could, it could be that they, they had some sort of an illness that they could transmit that they weren't just showing symptoms at the time. We will get a covid swab done just to make sure that that's not what's happening. It could be that. And I'll recommend that you continue to, you know, take Tylenol and rest and take care of yourself and if your symptoms worsen or stay the same for long period of time, definitely come back or call public health to get some guidance and try to stay away from others and self isolate for the next couple of days or at least clear covid swabs back or your symptoms improve. Or the next 14 days. So that's all I have for you today. Do you have any questions for me?
