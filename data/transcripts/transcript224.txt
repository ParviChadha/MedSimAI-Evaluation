**Patient: **Yeah, I would say approximately around the same time.
**Medical Student: **OK, OK. Um, do you always have the breathlessness, or does it come and go?
**Patient: **Um, I think it's, I feel short of breath most of the times, but it's mainly just gets worse when I'm exerting myself when I'm walking more than usual or just working in the garden.
**Medical Student: **OK, OK, um and same thing with the cough? It gets worse when you're walking around?
**Patient: **Yeah, I would say so.
**Medical Student: **OK. And was there any sort of trigger for this two years ago? Anything that you remember?
**Patient: **Um, no, it kind of just started gradually on its own. No, no real triggers that I can remember.
**Medical Student: **OK, and, does anything make it worse or better besides the exertion?
**Patient: **Uh, no, I think that's pretty much the only thing that really makes it worse.
**Medical Student: **OK, and how would you describe your breathlessness? Is it that you're breathing too fast or you can't catch your breath?
**Patient: **It's I think it's more so just I can't catch my breath and sometimes I just have trouble being able to take like a full breath.
**Medical Student: **OK, OK. Um, and out of 1 to 10, 10 being the worst, how bad is your breathlessness?

**Patient: **No, not that I know.
**Medical Student: **No um, and have you traveled anywhere recently?
**Patient: **No, No.
**Medical Student: **OK, um, have you been worked up for this in the past two years? Like have you had any chest X-rays or pulmonary function tests or anything like that?
**Patient: **No, I've never really had this issue before, so no investigations.
**Medical Student: **OK, OK, well those were all the questions that I had. Did you have anything that you wanted to add that I maybe missed?
**Patient: **Uh, no, I just it's been going on for two years and I feel like it's getting worse and worse. And yeah, I'm just scared of having to, you know, go on oxygen or like just not being able to breathe at one point.
**Medical Student: **Yeah, for sure. So we will try to do a good job working you up for everything that we think it may be. And right now, it sounds like it could be pulmonary fibrosis either like you know an autoimmune process or triggered after like an infection that you may have had in the past. We will definitely also look into see if it's perhaps a lung cancer, asthma and you mentioned you don't smoke so we don't think it could be COPD but we'll also test for that in case all everything else comes back negative.
**Patient: **OK, sounds good. Thank you so much.
**Control: **Add differential diagnosis
