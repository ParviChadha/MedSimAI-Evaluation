**Medical Student: **Alright. And uh, let's see so.. uh, you've had a fever, a cough, and a runny nose for the past few days. And have you been going to school? In the past couple of days or no?
**Patient: **I know I've taken the last couple of days off, just been so tired and not feeling good so, yeah well.
**Medical Student: **OK, OK. So yeah, it sounds like you might have some sort of viral infection which could potentially be covid, but could also be another sort of another viral illness, just like the common cold or the flu. Um, so I'll request that we get a covid swab done and the results should come back in 24 to 48 hours and um, just try to self isolate as much as possible. Don't go to school, don't meet other people. Try to stay away from your mom as well. And based on the results, you'll get more guidance from public health nurses, and you should just continue to sort of rest and drink lots of water. Maybe take Tylenol or Advil if that's making you feel better and hopefully your symptoms will get better. If not, if you feel like your symptoms are persisting for days or week or so, or you're having worsening symptoms, definitely come back or give us a call.
