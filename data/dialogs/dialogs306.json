We will get a covid swab done just to make sure that that's not what's happening. It could be that. And I'll recommend that you continue to, you know, take Tylenol and rest and take care of yourself and if your symptoms worsen or stay the same for long period of time, definitely come back or call public health to get some guidance and try to stay away from others and self isolate for the next couple of days or at least clear covid swabs back or your symptoms improve.
