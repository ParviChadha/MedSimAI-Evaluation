Uh and then we'll also get like your, some of your blood work and chest X-ray just to see if there's any like pneumonia. And lastly we'll just get like a Covid swab done since some of these symptoms also overlap with Covid symptoms. Um and yeah so we'll, so that's what we'll do um and I'll let the emergency department know that you're on your way. I think you'll need to get all those tests there, and then they'll decide whether or not you need any kind of admission or you can just go home on antibiotics um from there, OK?",
