So right now I'm just going through, you know, a list of differential diagnoses that you could possibly have and COVID, it's definitely top on my list and so we will likely get a swab and run those tests and try to get that back to you as soon as we can. It could also be other respiratory infections, especially viral infections this time of the year. And so, if it comes back negative for COVID, it's probably you know something else like respiratory virus or even the flu. So we'll go from there. And if it turns out it's not a viral infection, we will likely see if it's some sort of bacterial infection in which we can prescribe antibiotics for those. But it definitely sounds like there's an infectious picture going on here because of the acuteness of the presentation, and just your symptoms. So we will do afollow up in a week or so. Until then, we will run all these labs. Does that sound good?",
