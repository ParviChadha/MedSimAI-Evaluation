**Patient: **Um I don't think so. He was playing outside with the neighbours, um with the neighbour's kids, but I don't think he came into contact. I'm not sure.
**Medical Student: **OK, uh, has he been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
**Patient: **No, he's pretty healthy.
**Medical Student: **OK and sorry, just to to go back to the symptoms, I missed a few questions here. Did he have uh, does he have any nausea or vomiting?

**Patient: **Um no.
**Medical Student: **OK, and um are his immunizations up to date?

**Medical Student: **OK, yeah, that's uh well, it's important to know um today that he's not vaccinated, because certainly that will influence um what we're thinking about in terms of what could be causing the symptoms. Um and we can uh discuss the, I guess more about the vaccination procedures and what not later. Um but OK, so he's not currently vaccinated, and have there been any um concerns with his growth and or development?
**Patient: **No.
**Medical Student: **He's meeting all of the the milestones and doing well at school?
**Patient: **Yeah.
**Medical Student: **OK, um and in terms of the pregnancy, uh were there any complications during the pregnancy like gestational diabetes or or um high blood pressure?
**Patient: **Uh I did have gestational diabetes.
**Medical Student: **Uh sorry yeah, did that require insulin or?
**Patient: **Uh yeah, I did have to take insulin. Um he was he was also a pretty big baby when he was born, um we had to, I had to give, get a C-section done.
**Medical Student: **OK, were there any complications with the with the procedure, with the surgery?
**Patient: **No no, no complications at all.
**Medical Student: **OK, did he have any um like breathing problems or jaundice or any reasons to stay in the hospital when when he was born?

**Patient: **No.
**Medical Student: **How about a family history of any bleeding disorders or or clotting disorders or cancers?
**Patient: **Um no.
**Medical Student: **OK. Um so that was everything that I think I wanted to ask about on history. Um so it sounds like um he's had a cough, um a runny nose, um some red eye red eyes that, with some tearing as well as a rash that that started and and a fever. Was there any other symptoms?
**Patient: **No.
**Medical Student: **Alright. Um so next we'll go on to the physical exam. We'll want to have a look um at the rash and get the vitals, um but there is a concern that this is, could be, uh Measles and so um it'll be important to um, supportive management and um ensure that um it's not passed on to um anybody else. That reminds me, yeah, he was out playing with other children, were any other kids experiencing similar symptoms?
**Patient: **Um I'm not sure I I guess I need to talk to their their parents now.
**Medical Student: **Yeah it would be um a good idea to uh yeah contact um and see, just to make sure that we're treating everybody appropriately.
**Patient: **Sure.
**Medical Student: **And then uh we could talk more about the vaccination um later.
**Control: **Add differential diagnosis
